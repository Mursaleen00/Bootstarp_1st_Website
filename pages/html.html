        <h2 id="top" class="text-capitalize">what is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML
            documents are made up of a series of elements, which can include text, images, videos, and other types of
            media. These elements are enclosed in tags, which are used to indicate the type of element and to provide
            additional information about it. <br>

            The basic structure of an HTML document includes a head and a body. The head contains information about the
            document, such as the title, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. The body contains the
            main content of the document, such as text, images, and links. <br>

            HTML also includes a wide range of tags for creating different types of content, such as headings,
            paragraphs, lists, images, tables, and forms. It also supports multimedia elements like audio and video.
            Additionally, HTML5, the latest version of HTML, includes new tags for creating modern web applications and
            adding semantic meaning to the document. <br>

            HTML is used in conjunction with other web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to create interactive and
            visually appealing websites. <br>

            It is important to note that HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It's used to structure
            and describe the content of a webpage, but it doesn't have the logic or computational abilities of a
            programming language.</p>







        <h2 class=" text-capitalize">Why we use html?</h2>
        <p>HTML is used to create the structure and layout of a webpage. It allows developers to define the headings,
            paragraphs, links, images, and other elements that make up a webpage, and to specify how they should be
            rendered in a web browser. <br>

            HTML provides a standard set of tags and attributes that can be used to create a wide range of different
            types of webpages, from simple static pages to more complex interactive applications. By using these tags,
            developers can create well-structured, accessible, and search engine friendly webpages that are easy to
            navigate and understand. <br>

            HTML is also used to create web-based applications, such as online forms and shopping carts, which can be
            used to collect data from users and to provide them with interactive experiences. <br>

            Additionally, HTML is an open standard, which means that it can be used on any platform, operating system or
            device that has a web browser, making it accessible to a wide range of users. <br>

            In summary, HTML is used to create the structure, layout and content of webpages, making it the foundation
            of the web, providing the ability to create accessible, interactive and engaging websites.</p>





        <h2 class="text-capitalize">what is the role of html in website?</h2>
        <p>HTML plays a crucial role in creating websites. It is the foundation of any webpage, providing the structure
            and layout for the content that is displayed to users.</p>
        <p> The following are some of the key roles that HTML plays in creating websites:</p>
        <ul class="ul_style">
            <li>Structure: HTML defines the structure of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and
                other elements. These elements are used to organize the content of a webpage and make it easy to
                navigate.</li>
            <li>Content: HTML is used to create the content of a webpage, including text, images, videos, and other
                types of media. It also provides tags for adding semantic meaning to the content, such as headings,
                paragraphs, and lists.</li>
            <li>Interactivity: HTML allows developers to create interactive elements, such as forms and buttons, which
                can be used to collect data from users and to provide them with interactive experiences.</li>
            <li>Accessibility: HTML provides features for creating accessible websites, such as the ability to add
                alternative text to images and to create structured headings and paragraphs.</li>
            <li>SEO: HTML provides tags and attributes that can be used to provide information to search engines, such
                as the title and description of a webpage, and to create structured data, which can be used to improve a
                webpage's visibility in search results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, HTML is the backbone of a website, providing the structure, content, interactivity, accessibility
            and search engine optimization elements to a webpage. It enables a webpage to be rendered correctly by web
            browsers and ensures that the webpage is accessible to a wide range of users.</p>
