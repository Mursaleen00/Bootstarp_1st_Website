        <h2 class="text-capitalize">what is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML documents are made up of a series of elements, which can include text, images, videos, and other types of media. These elements are enclosed in tags, which are used to indicate the type of element and to provide additional information about it. <br> 

            The basic structure of an HTML document includes a head and a body. The head contains information about the document, such as the title, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. The body contains the main content of the document, such as text, images, and links. <br>
            
            HTML also includes a wide range of tags for creating different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, tables, and forms. It also supports multimedia elements like audio and video. Additionally, HTML5, the latest version of HTML, includes new tags for creating modern web applications and adding semantic meaning to the document. <br>
            
            HTML is used in conjunction with other web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites. <br>
            
            It is important to note that HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It's used to structure and describe the content of a webpage, but it doesn't have the logic or computational abilities of a programming language.</p>







        <h2 class=" text-capitalize">Why we use html?</h2>
        <p>HTML is used to create the structure and layout of a webpage. It allows developers to define the headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other elements that make up a webpage, and to specify how they should be rendered in a web browser. <br>

            HTML provides a standard set of tags and attributes that can be used to create a wide range of different types of webpages, from simple static pages to more complex interactive applications. By using these tags, developers can create well-structured, accessible, and search engine friendly webpages that are easy to navigate and understand. <br>
            
            HTML is also used to create web-based applications, such as online forms and shopping carts, which can be used to collect data from users and to provide them with interactive experiences. <br>
            
            Additionally, HTML is an open standard, which means that it can be used on any platform, operating system or device that has a web browser, making it accessible to a wide range of users. <br>
            
            In summary, HTML is used to create the structure, layout and content of webpages, making it the foundation of the web, providing the ability to create accessible, interactive and engaging websites.</p>
